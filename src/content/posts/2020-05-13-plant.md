Well, as you (including I and probably the entire world) might have expected the geniuses at MIT are at it again, but this time they went overboard. These people finally created a device that showed the face of the fastest thing yet known to mankind. Well now they’re like “wait hold on, I think it’s time for us people to take a selfie with light” and boom!!! They built the amazing TRILLION FRAMES PER SECOND IMAGING SYSTEM that works in ways my eyes crisscrossed when I first read about it. But to give a peek of the flickers I understood “This system creates images **that are fast enough** to produce a **slow-motion video** of a **burst of light** traveling the length of a one-liter bottle, bouncing off the cap and reflecting back to the bottle’s bottom.” And don’t get me started on how the world can utilize it. But I leave that for you guys to contemplate.
